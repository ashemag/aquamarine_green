                    In early 2010, Robert Bonesteel, proprietor of <strong>Aqua Marine Construction</strong>, concentrating on waterfront development and Lily Schwabe, a UN Representative for an NGO engaged Sustainable Development and Climate Change at the United Nations started discussing the need for grassroots initiatives and businesses at a local level dealing with the green economy and sustainable development. With the financial crisis hitting in October 2008 and energy prices soaring to record highs, a grassroots movement to preserve the quality of American life is emerging.

                    The idea of <strong>Aqua Marine Green</strong>, a sister company to <strong>Aqua Marine Construction</strong> was developed. Robert Bonesteel has been recycling homes in LBI and Beach Haven West for over 20 years. Aqua Marine&apos;s first house move was in 1992. As property values skyrocketed in the area, Homeowners were demolishing homes to build new ones. These homes were in good condition and just needed a little TLC and a new owner. Aqua Marine Construction has moved over 20 homes in the LBI area.
